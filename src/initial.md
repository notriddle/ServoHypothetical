# Hypothetical computed values

In [CSS level 2 ยง 9.7](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#dis-pos-flo),
the computed values of display, position, and float are normalized
to avoid clashing values.

When this specification refers to the hypothetical computed values
for these properties,
these values should be used:

  * hypothetical value of display: the computed value of display
    that would have resulted if ยง 9.7 had not been applied.
  * hypothetical value of position: the keyword "static"
  * hypothetical value of float: the computed value of display
    that would have resulted if ยง 9.7 had not been applied.
